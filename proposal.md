# Project Description

For our major project, Michael and I are planning to recreate the game "Plants vs. Zombies" in Javascript using p5.js. "Plants vs. Zombies" is a defence-style game in which players place different types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around a house, in order to stop a horde of zombies from reaching their house. Through the construction of this game, we hope to advance our understanding of coding past what is taught in the Computer Science 30 Curricula.

# Needs To Have List

- Visually appealing game UI with css styling
- Main adventure mode with at least one fully functioning level
    - Mimicking the real game, we want generated sunlight as currency to buy plants and a wave of randomly generated zombies 
- Unique plants and zombies that are unlocked with the playthrough
- Animations on sprites with iterations (plants, zombies, resources, interactions, etc)
- An audio component with sound effects and background music
- Functional lawnmowers, shovels, pause/resume buttons
- Functional game message popups triggered upon conditions
