# CS Person Feedback

- A cooldown between planting would make the game feel harder
- Screen animations when zombie is approaching the house
- Animations between potato and zombie stages (half zombie health = arm falls off) (Potato display based on health)
- expiry timer on the sunflower and game-generated sun
- A win state and a screen should pop up when you reach the end of the zombies spawning.
- Maybe incorporate "big waves" to enhance the difficulty of the game


# Normal Person Feedback

- I think the game would be more enjoyable if it was more difficult; the sun spawns too fast and I can plant as much sun as I want with no cooldown
- The game should let me win
- The pause button could be more interactive
- The potato mine, cherry bomb, and chomper would be really cool additions if you figured out how to make it work
- The main menu buttons are slightly off at times
- More music and sound effects would be cool and make the game feel more complete
- More levels would be great
